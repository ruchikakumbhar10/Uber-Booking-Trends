🚖 Uber Booking Trends Analysis
📌 1. Project Title

Uber Booking Trends: Demand & Ride Pattern Analysis using Excel and Power BI

📖 2. Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing Uber ride booking data to identify booking patterns, peak demand hours, ride distribution, and payment preferences.

The objective was to transform raw ride data into meaningful business insights that can help optimize driver allocation, reduce cancellations, and improve operational efficiency.

Using Excel for data cleaning and preprocessing and Power BI for advanced visualization, the project delivers an interactive dashboard that highlights key booking trends and performance indicators.

🎯 3. Business Problem

Ride-hailing platforms like Uber experience fluctuating demand throughout the day.

Without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to:

Identify peak booking hours

Understand cancellation trends

Allocate drivers efficiently

Optimize operational performance

This project analyzes ride demand to understand when and where bookings surge or drop, helping support data-driven decision-making.

📊 4. Dataset Overview

Analyzed 10,000+ Uber ride records

Dataset includes:

Ride ID

Booking Status

Vehicle Type

Pickup Time

Payment Method

Ride Value

Cancellation Details

🧹 5. Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel)

To ensure accurate analysis, the dataset was carefully cleaned using Excel:

Removed duplicate records

Handled missing/null values

Standardized categorical values

Created structured tables

Used filters and sorting for validation

Built Pivot Tables for summary insights

This preprocessing ensured data reliability before visualization in Power BI.

📈 6. Dashboard & Visualization (Power BI)

Developed 8+ interactive visuals including:

KPI Cards (Total Rides, Completed Rides, Cancellations)

Booking Status Distribution Chart

Vehicle Type Analysis

Time-of-Day Booking Trends

Payment Method Breakdown

Peak Hour Demand Visualization

Interactive Slicers for dynamic filtering

The dashboard allows users to explore ride patterns dynamically.
