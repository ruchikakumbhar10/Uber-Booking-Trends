# 🚖 Uber Booking Trends Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Uber ride booking data to uncover booking patterns, demand fluctuations, cancellation trends, and customer preferences.

Using **Excel for data cleaning** and **Power BI for interactive visualization**, the project transforms raw ride data into meaningful business insights that support operational decision-making.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Ride-hailing platforms experience fluctuating demand throughout the day.  
Without structured analysis, it becomes difficult to:

- Identify peak booking hours  
- Understand ride cancellations  
- Allocate drivers efficiently  
- Improve operational performance  

This project analyzes ride demand to understand **when bookings surge or drop**, enabling data-driven business decisions.
